# TMO – Task Matrix Organizer

**TMO (Task Matrix Organizer)** is a web-based **task management** system designed to help students and professionals organize their tasks efficiently, according to their own logic and priorities. Built as a full-stack individual project for the Web Development module at **Inteli – Instituto de Tecnologia e Liderança**, incorporating both UX design and programming, this application emphasizes **productivity, customization, and intuitive UX.**

---

## Project Objective

The main goal of **TMO** is to provide a smart and flexible environment for managing personal tasks, helping users categorize, prioritize, and track their to-dos in a way that suits their workflow — whether that’s by urgency, due date, status, or custom tags.

<!-- 
## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: 
- **API Architecture**: 

--- -->

## Core Features

- User registration and login
- Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) tasks
- Organize tasks by:
  - Priority
  - Due date
  - Status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done)
  - Custom tags
- Filter and sort task lists
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
- Visual feedback to enhance usability without tutorials

---

## Target Users

The primary users of **TMO** are individuals who are reasonably comfortable with technology and seek a more customizable, flexible setup for task organization. A key example is a **university student** with a demanding academic schedule, who needs a clean, efficient tool to manage tasks across multiple contexts — from classes and labs to personal projects.

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/m4ichel/TMO

2. Install backend dependencies:
cd backend
npm install

3. Install frontend dependencies:
cd ../frontend
npm install

4. Set up your `.env` files for both backend and frontend.

5. Run the development servers:
- Backend (development): `npm run dev` (on port 3000 or other if not available)
- Backend (production): `npm start` (on port 3000 or other if not available)
- Frontend: `npm run dev` 

6. Run migrations: `npm run init-db`

7. Testing the API: use an API client like Postman to test routes. Example: `GET /users` → List all users
